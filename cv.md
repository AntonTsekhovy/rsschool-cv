## Briefly About Myself:

I am 33 years old, I live in Minsk. My current job has no career growth, salary growth, development of any skills. The lack of prospects and development is the main reason why I want to change the field of activity. I chose Frontend, this direction seemed interesting to me. I hope that everything will work out with rolling-scopes-school.
